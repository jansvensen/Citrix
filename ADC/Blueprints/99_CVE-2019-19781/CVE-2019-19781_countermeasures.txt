- Take the ADC instance from the network
- Changes the password of all LDAP or other AD / network accounts stored on the ADC
- Issues a new SSL certificate and a new key file for all client SSL files on the device (The keys are stored in files on the ADC that could theoretically be read by the attacker)
- If it is a VPX appliance and snapshots of the appliance (older than January 9, 2020) are available, it may be worthwhile to restore it first, but this is NOT A WARRANTY for security
-- To be on the safe side, export the configuration file of the affected system and copy / restore it to a new fresh VPX appliance
-- Make sure that the same hardware address is used, otherwise the license is invalid and must be requested / imported again
-- Disconnect the network before starting
-- Launch the appliance and check via the console that the VPX is not compromised
-- Change the nsroot password
-- Connect the internal network only
-- Perform the fix listed above
-- Connecting the external network
-- Keep an eye on the protocols and responder hits
-- Replace the SSL certificates on the appliance at the earliest possible time
